# Core concepts

Homas is a new kind of human resource software. Its main goals are to:
- help managers to be more empathetic,
- help companies be better at managing people dreams and ambitions,
- help employees communicate with their employers.

In terms of user experience, the software aims to be simple to use with the minimum amount of configuration. Design is not a priority - user experience is.

Technically, the software is developed with boring, proven, predictible, easy to maintain technologies that make the tool fast and secure. We want to create a stable product useful for our users, not something that is technologically exciting.

To use the software, users have to pay a fair fixed monthly fee, regardless of the size of your team. We do not sell your data, don't use ads or use external analytical services. You can export your data at anytime or use the API without restrictions.
